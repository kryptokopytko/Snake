# Snake
A fresh take on a timeless game, where everything is colorful. It's a challenge for your fingers, cone cells and memory.

It introduces obstacles, that look exactly like food, that will kill you the moment you touch them. You can tell whether a given square is food or trap by comparing it's color to the color of your head, if they match then the square is indeed food. Be aware, the moment you eat your color will change, and a new obstacle will spawn. Sometimes colors of squares will be very similar, you can either rub off a suspicious square to know for sure (even tiny differences will show, as a line that divides you from the square, if you picked a trap), or you can remember the order of spawn of the points, the oldest one is the right one.

To build you just need to type `make snake`
